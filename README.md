The second iteration of my website portfolio. Used to showscase all my current and past projects in the last 12 months. 

Please, do not clone this repository unless you are a recruiter. If you copy my work and try to pass it off as your own (this has happened before!), I will know.

- This version uses Vite instead of CRA, which should reduce loading time on users and during development.
- It looks much more professional than my current website, adhering to modern design principles.
- The code uses TypeScript to be more modular in nature as opposed to just using code JS, which ensures a cleaner code structure.
